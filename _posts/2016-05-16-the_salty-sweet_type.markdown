Why did I decide that I wanted to learn about software development? The short answer is because chocolate covered pretzels are one of my most favorite things.

If you'd like to know the extra-long version, it starts with me being bored in middle school. I was sitting at my desk in English class while my teacher was going over sentence structure. I had "The Fellowship of the Ring" propped up inside my English textbook and was completely absorbed because I was reading the bit where Frodo first encounters the Nazgul and ... Ok, I'll spare you ALL the details but it mostly has to do with the type of person I am: I am a contrary person. I am a person who appreciates the logic of science and yet also enjoys the vagaries of English, a person who always resented the rigid regimen of math but exceled in the exacting details of drafting and design. If I get a shake from McDonald's I really need to buy French fries to go along with it so I can sip a bit of the shake and then immediately eat a bite of fry. All the contrariness gets smashed and mixed up inside me to make a big 'ol wonderful and paradoxical stew of personality. You get the picture, right? I'm the salty AND sweet at the same time type of person. And now all this talk of stews and shakes has made me horribly hungry.

But what does this have to do with programming, you ask? (Or you might ask if you were even remotely curious about the actual topic of this post, especially considering the food tangent I just went off on. If you're not then I'm not really sure why you're reading this. Maybe you thought it was a foodie blog? In either case you're just going to have to bear with me, ok? I promise I'm getting to it.)

Mostly, I tripped into the quicksand of learning about software development because I am a girl who likes to play video games and who enjoys mucking about on her computer, whose friends are mostly other nerds who also like video games and mucking about on their computers. After the initial flirtations with HTML and CSS, programming grew on me, yes, like shiny, binary mold and, like mold, also grew to build upon and enhance the bits of me that were already there.

When I first started learning about programming the structure and protocol of the code relaxed me. Yes relaxed, the way alphabetizing my cd collection (don't ask me what a cd is, go google it) always relaxed me. My mind likes putting things into perfect and neat little boxes, the code I learned seemed to be able to package up just about anything. A bit later the logic of tackling a specific problem would really impel me. I dislike riddles but love taking apart a problem and solving it because I get lost in the search for the solutions. Even later still when I started learning Ruby I was inordinately pleased at the efficiency and elegance of the language itself, it was like a good Emily Dickinson poem, but preferably one of the good ones like "Hope" or "I'm nobody" where she's decisive with her word usage and a bit funny too. In fewer words, I eventually came to the realization that programming parallels and fulfills my contrary nature. It's all the things I like, a bit of linguistics, a bit of poetry, some logic and framework and symmetry, all rolled up into something that is intrinsically creative and a bit philosophical too. Like all the best parts of me.

And ... I wrote all of that to back this up: programming simply seems to fit me, like pretzels and potato chips do chocolate. Or fries do vanilla shakes. Whatever food metaphor you'd enjoy devouring the most.
